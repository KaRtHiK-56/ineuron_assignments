    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "     functions are used in a program to make it more readable and more easy to understand and reusability, functions makes program to follow bottom to top approach.it breaks the complex program it simple and easier piece and more readiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "    when ever the function is defined in a program the program will execute all other statements untill or unless the function \n",
    "is called ,so the function gets executed when ever it is called.\n",
    "\n",

    "        statememt_1\n",
    "        statememt_2 .....\n",
    "    this is used to create a function\n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "    when ever the function is created in a program the program will execute all other statements untill or unless the function \n",
    "is called , so defining a function is useless as it wont be executed unless it is called \n",

    "\n",
    "ans :  in a program we can create as many global scope and local scope depending on the program type.\n",
    "    types of scope : global , local , enclosed and builtin \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "     when a function returns the local variable retains its value , ie. the variable gets occupies or destroyed so they cannot be using same local variable to a value again.\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "     the return is a value that is used inside a function which gives a value when it is finished its execution. it can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. yes , it is possible to have aexpression as a function \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "    when a function does not have a return value , it does not give nothing when the program gets executed , like it wont display anything in output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "    it is done using declarring the global keyword to the variable inside the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : nonetype, is the data type of None\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",

    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "        error handling can be used to prevent a programme from crashing\n",
    "        \n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans :\n",
    "    The try block allows you to test a block of code for errors.if no error is present it get executed and returns somrthing and the except block enables you to handle the error that if occured in program and returns a reply of the error type."
